# The Traffic Court

The Traffic Court hears and tries traffic offences. It deals with all
fresh traffic arrest cases, Traffic Police summonses/notices where there
are no offers of composition as well as Land Transport Authority
summonses/notices where there are no offers of composition.

It operates as a mentions court which deals with a wide variety of
applications including applications for bail, remand and adjournments
and is involved in the management of traffic cases. It is also the trial
court for traffic cases.

## Traffic offences *without* any offer of composition

If there is no offer of composition, you are required to attend the
Traffic Court on the date and time stipulated. Once you have been dealt
with by the Traffic Court, you will be given either a fine ticket (blue
in colour) or a Fine Advice Chit by the Court Officer. You can make the
payment at the Finance Section which is located at Level one of the
State Courts, Havelock Square Complex.

## Minor traffic offences *with* an offer of composition

A traffic offence is considered minor if there is an offer of
composition stated on the traffic ticket or notice. There is an offer of
composition if the ticket or notice states a sum of money which you can
pay to settle the ticket or notice without going to court.

**AXS Stations:** Anyone who receives a traffic ticket or notice from
the Traffic Police Department, Land Transport Authority, Housing and
Development Board or Urban Redevelopment Authority for a minor traffic
offence may use the AXS Station to settle the fine.

If the offer of composition has expired, users can use the Automated
Traffic Offence Management System (ATOMS) to settle their tickets or
notices by pleading guilty to the traffic offence stated in their ticket
or notice and pay a court fine. With ATOMS, users can settle their
traffic tickets at their convenience and there is no need to go to
court.

ATOMS is run on the AXS Stations which are located island-wide. You can
call the AXS Hotline at [6560 2727](tel:+6565602727) or visit their
website at <http://www.axs.com.sg> to find the AXS Station nearest to
you.

Please note that the operating hours for the AXS Hotline are:

8.00 am to 10.00 pm daily

(including Sundays and public holidays)

## Commonly Asked Questions on the Traffic Court

**Can I claim legal aid for a traffic offence?**

Yes, it is possible but not guaranteed, as there are rules on
eligibility for free legal aid, depending on the individual lawyer/ law
firm or other organization you approach in regards to your case.

**Should I hire a lawyer, or can I represent myself in Court?**

This depends on whether your traffic offence is a minor or serious one.

Your traffic ticket/notice will indicate whether your traffic offence is
serious or minor. If the ticket specifies an “offer of composition”,
your offence is considered minor. You can pay a “composition” to settle
the ticket/notice without going to court (thus, you do not have to hire
counsel), provided you pay on time.

If there is no offer of composition, your offence is considered serious.
You must attend court on the appointed date. If you plead guilty, the
court will impose a sentence. If you claim trial, a date will be set for
the case to be heard. [^1]

**On what grounds can my licence be suspended/revoked?**

Singapore's demerit points system named the Driver Improvement Points
System (DIPS) was introduced on 1 March 1983. DIPS is designed to identify
and rehabilitate errant drivers through a system of rewards and punishments.
Errant motorists are thus encouraged to imporve their driving behaviours on the
roads with incentives to expunge their demerit points and previous suspension
records as well as remission of suspension period.

For new motorists who are *under one year of probation* from the date of
grant on their dirving licence, the driving licence can be revoked and
become invalid when 13 or more demerit points are accumulated. The
licence holder will have to retake all necessary tests to obtain a
licence again.

For *non-probation motorists*, where they have no previous suspension
record with Traffic Police, and they have accumulated 24 or more demerit
points within 24 consecuive months, their driving licence will become
liable for the 1^st^ suspension of 12 weeks. If a motorists has a
previous suspension record with Traffice Police, and they have
accumulated 12 or more demerit points within 12 months, their driving
lience will become liable for the subsequent suspension. For subsequent
suspensions after the 1^st^ suspension, the suspension periods are:

-   2^nd^ suspension: 24 weeks
-   3^rd^ suspension: 1 year
-   4^th^ suspension: 2 years
-   5^th^ suspension (onwards): 3 years

Where the suspension period lasts a year or longer (ie. 3^rd^ suspension
and onwards), the driving licence will be revoked and become invalid.
The licence holder will have to retake all the necessary driving tests
(theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride again.

Motorists liable for 1^st^ and 2^nd^ suspension will offer a retraining
course to correct their driving beaviours. If they take and pass the
retraining course, their suspension period will be given a remission.
For 1st suspension, the suspension period will be reduced from 12 weeks
to 4 weeks. If none of their traffic offences leading to their 1st
suspension was involved in traffic accident, their suspension period
will be further reduced to 1 week; and for 2nd suspension, it will be
reduced from 24 weeks to 12 weeks.

There is no offer of retraining course and remission for 3rd and
subsequent suspensions.

**What are the offences listed under DIPS?**

Under the DIPS, demerit points are given from a list of scheduled
offences under the Road Traffic (DIPS) Rules.

**What do I do if issued with a warrant of arrest?**

If you have settled all your traffic summonses, and would like to find
out why there is a warrant of arrest issued against you, you can send an
email to: SPF_TP_Summons_Processing@spf.gov.sg or call (65) 6547 0000 to check.

*Warrants are typically issued when a person fails to appear in court or
is being sought on criminal charges.* It is best to consult a criminal
lawyer for advice on how to possibly avoid being locked up, and not less
importantly, to prepare for your defense.

The Warrant will be handed over to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a
division of the Singapore Police Force) or the respective enforcement
agencies for them to execute. The police will either arrest you or you
may be asked to surrender yourself at the Warrant Enforcement Unit for
the warrant to be executed.

As a condition of the Warrant of Arrest, bail may or may not be offered
upon arrest. If no bail is offered, you will be brought to Court within
48 hours of your arrest; if bail is offered, you will be asked to
furnish the bail sum before you may be released to attend Court on a
specified date. If you are unable to find a bailor, you will be brought
to Court within 48 hours of your arrest. In certain cases, you may be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence pending your
arrest.

**How can I get a charge withdrawn?**

If you in fact committed the offence charged against you, there is no
way that the charge can be withdrawn completely. However, if you feel
that you did not commit the offence, or that the summons was not
justifiable, you may make an appeal by writing to the Traffic Police or
LTA. [^3]

**Traffic Police appeals**

Write to:
Chief Investigation Officer, Violation Reports  
Investigation Branch, Traffic Police Department,  
10 Ubi Avenue 3, Singapore 408865

Email: SPF_TP_Summons_Processing@spf.gov.sg

**LTA appeals**

Write to: <https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=AddAppeal>

**Can the number of charges against me be reduced?**

If you think you have a good reason for committing the offence, you can
try to mitigate the offence. Use an *AXS
station\*](http://www.axs.com.sg/axsStation_locations.php) and answer
“Yes” when asked if you want to mitigate the offence. You will be
required to attend a court hearing and explain your reasons to the
judge. [^4]

Commonly Asked Questions on Handphone Driving [^5]

For the offence of handphone driving to stand, **ALL** the following 3
conditions must be fulfilled:

1. The vehicle is in motion
2. The driver is holding on to the handphone with one hand; while his
   other hand is holding the steering wheel
3. The driver is communicating with any person with that handphone

**Note:** If the driver is not holding on to the steering wheel at all,
he can be charged for reckless or dangerous driving. Upon conviction,
first-time offenders can be fined up to S\$3000/-, or jailed for a term
up to 12 months, or both. Repeat offenders are liable for a maximum fine
of S\$5000/-, or to imprisonment for a term up to 2 years, or both. In
addition, they may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driving licence. This includes making phone calls, paging someone,
receiving a call by pressing the keypad, and reading, writing or sending
an SMS.

**Purpose of the rules:** The purpose of setting the three conditions is
to ensure that drivers who have no intention to commit handphone driving
will not be caught by ambiguous rules. For example, a driver who simply
holds a mobile phone but is not using it to communicate while driving
will not have committed the offence. However, if by doing so, the driver
loses attention on the roads and fails to maintain proper control of his
vehicle, he will still have committed an offence of driving without due
care or reasonable consideration.

Similarly, the spirit of the law is such that the driver who uses his
handphone is only a menace to other road users if his vehicle is moving.
Hence, drivers who use their handphones while their vehicles are
stationary will not be caught.

In short, Traffic Police do not take action against motorists for
handphone driving simply because there is a handphone on the passenger
seat or beside the driver. Traffic Police will only take action when our
observations show that all the three conditions for the offence of
handphone driving are concurrently present.

All handphone driving offenders will be prosecuted in court, regardless
of whether the motorist is a first-timer or repeat offender. A
first-timer convicted of phone and drive offence shall be liable to 12
demerit points and a maximum fine of up to \$1000/- or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. He/She may also be
disqualified from driving. The offender's handphone and SIM card will be
seized to facilitate investigation. These may be forfeited by the court
upon conviction.

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario A (Paging for someone):** Page for someone, with or without
earpiece, using one hand to hold on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario B (SMS/MMS message):** Writing, Sending, and Reading SMS/MMS
messages from someone, with or without earpiece, using one hand to hold
on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario C (Making a Call):** Making a call, with or without earpiece,
by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand while
driving.

**Scenario D (Receiving a Call):** Receiving a call, with or without
earpiece, by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand
while driving.
