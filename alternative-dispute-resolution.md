# Alternative Dispute Resolution

## What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?

Alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, refers to a range of procedures
for resolving disputes between parties **outside of the traditional
court system**. These include:

* **Arbitration** - A person or panel selected by the parties decides the
  dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments.
* **Mediation** - A neutral person helps the parties find a mutually
  acceptable resolution of their dispute.
* **Adjudication** - Commercial use of an adjudicator, who is a neutral third
  party, to decide issues between parties.
* **Neutral Evaluation** - An expert identifies each side’s strengths and weaknesses
  and suggests the likely amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded at trial.
* **Settlement Conferences** - A judge meets with the parties to explore settlement
 options and encourages them to agree upon a resolution of their dispute.

The various ADR procedures range from non-evaluative, informal methods
such as conciliation and facilitation to more evaluative and formal
mechanisms such as arbitration and neutral evaluation.

### Arbitration

Arbitration is a consensual process by which parties submit their
differences to one or more impartial persons, the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators, for resolution through a final and binding decision.

Below are some of the key features of arbitration:

**Confidentiality:** While similar to court litigation in that
proceedings are adversarial and decisions are binding, arbitration
offers a high degree of confidentiality to parties (the proceedings are
private), more flexibility in terms of rules and procedures used as well
as greater international enforceability of judgements over court
decisions.

Under the New York Convention to which Singapore is a signatory,
arbitral awards have extra-territorial enforceability in over 120
countries.

**Time and cost saving:** Resolving disputes through arbitration instead
of litigation can sometimes save time and money for the parties
involved, as arbitral proceedings can in certain cases be faster and
more cost-efficient.

The characteristics of arbitration make it particularly suited for
commercial disputes, especially where confidentiality is important to
the parties involved. Almost every civil dispute can be referred to
arbitration.

However matters involving moral questions or questions of law cannot be
resolved by arbitration. Matters not referred to arbitration include:

1. Matrimonial matters, like divorce or maintenance.
2. Bankruptcy matters, eg. declaring a person as an insolvent.
3. Criminal offences.

### Mediation

Mediation is a non-adversarial consensual process in which a neutral
person, the mediator, helps parties to settle their disputes through
a conciliatory process of discussion and narrowing differences.

Parties in mediations make their own decisions, with the help of the
mediator in shaping the outcome of the dispute. The mediator does
**not** have the final decision-making power. Should parties fail to
come to an agreement, they are permitted to walk away from the
mediation session without a positive outcome. Successful mediation
depends on the co-operation of all parties in implementing the
agreed upon solution, since the process (unlike arbitration) is
non-binding unless the parties agree to be contractually bound by
the terms of settlement.

The focus in mediation is on finding a practical solution acceptable
to all parties that helps to preserve the working relationship on
all sides.

### Adjudication

Adjudication is similar to arbitration, although there is a set
timeframe within which the adjudicator must make a decision and
parties are responsible for their own costs unless otherwise agreed.
Decisions made in adjudication, as for arbitration, are binding
unless these are later overturned by an arbitration or
court judgment.

Commonly used in the construction industry to ensure payment and
resolve other types of disputes, adjudication is aimed at being
faster and more cost effective than either litigation
or arbitration.

In general, the flexible nature of ADR and the various options
available allows parties to choose the most appropriate way for
resolving their disputes without unnecessary cost or delay.

### Neutral Evaluation

This is a structured proceeding, but conducted informally. Both
parties and their lawyers present their side of the case and key
evidence to one another and the evaluator, who is a
settlement judge.

The evaluator then reviews the case and provides an assessment of
the merits, which is his best estimate of the parties' likelihood of
success at trial.

Neutral evaluation can be used to either settle, or as a basis for
settlement of negotiations.

### Settlement Conferences

These are meetings in which a judge or volunteer attorney assists
opposing parties, to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of their
dispute without having to proceed to a trial. The judge will
evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case, without making
any decisions or orders in the case.

Such a conference may be initiated through either party, or it may
be ordered by the court as a precedent to holding a trial. Parties
are usually represented at the settlement conference by their
own lawyers.

## Alternative Dispute Resolution in Singapore

The following section provides an overview of various ADR services
available in Singapore to businesses and individuals.

### General Commercial Disputes

**A. Mediation**

**Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC)**

Services provided by the SMC include Mediation, Neutral Evaluation,
Mediation-Arbitration ("Med-Arb") and the Singapore Domain Name dispute
resolution. Online ADR services are also available through the dispute
manager website (see section on online ADR below).

The SMC also administers the Small Case Commercial Mediation Scheme
(SCCMS), which is designed to provide cheap mediation services for cases
where the quantum of a claim is S\$60,000 or less. The first two hours
of mediation are free.

Its panel of mediators and neutrals includes leaders from different
professions and industries who have undergone formal mediation training
and rigorous evaluation. SMC also has an international panel of
mediators that parties may choose from.

Fees depend on the quantum in dispute and the seniority and number of
mediators.

The SMC can be found at -

**Mediation in the State Courts**

State Courts attempt to provide a holistic approach to dispute
resolution, including mediation, in a variety of matters -

1.  **Criminal matters** - After the complainant files a summons, a
    notice may be issued for both the complainant and respondent to
    appear for mediation before a Magistrate or in the Community
    Mediation Centre.
2.  **Small Claims Tribunals** - Generally, claims less than \$10,000
    are heard here. Parties normally comprise consumer and supplier, and
    are asked to attend a mediation or “consultation” session before a
    Small Claims Tribunals Registrar.
3.  **Other civil matters** - Other civil disputes may be referred for
    mediation by the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre (PDRC), please
    see below for further details. The PDRC will only schedule a
    mediation session when all the pleadings – all documents required to
    commence an action or defend a case – have been filed and all the
    parties consent to the mediation.

    If the case is a non-injury motor accident (NIMA) or personal injury
    (PI), a notice to attend Court Dispute Resolution will be sent to
    your lawyer.

    If the case is not NIMA or PI, then either party may apply for
    mediation after obtaining permission of all parties.

4.  **Family matters** - Parties involved in divorce proceedings in the
    Family Court may be referred for mediation in the Family Resolutions
    Chambers or the Child Focused Resolution Centre. Mediation is also
    conducted by the Maintenance Mediation Chambers when parties file
    maintenance complaints.

*What Goes on During Mediation at the PDRC*

**Ad Hoc Mediation**

Parties can also arrange, for a fee, an *ad hoc* mediation through
law firms or various other private service providers. These
mediators will facilitate discussions between the parties to
facilitate settlement.

**B. Arbitration**

**Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)**

SIAC is an arbitral institution that offers a neutral and
independent venue for parties to resolve their disputes. Its
services include arbitrator appointment and case administration
(including financial management, logistical and
institutional support) to parties involved in commercial disputes,
both domestic and international.

With the exception of criminal and family law matters, almost any
civil case that can be taken to court can be resolved by arbitration
at SIAC if the parties agree. Fees charged for arbitration include a
management fee pegged to the amount in the dispute as well as the
arbitrator's fee, which depends on the complexity and quantum of the
dispute as well as the seniority of the arbitrators.

SIAC has a regional panel and an international panel of arbitrators,
comprising of legal and industry experts in a broad range of
subject areas. Parties are also free to appoint their own
arbitrators if they prefer.

**Other Arbitration Rules / Ad Hoc Arbitration**

Parties may also agree to arbitrate in Singapore in *ad hoc*
arbitrations or under other arbitration rules such as the ICC rules
or UNCITRAL rules. Where parties do not use an arbitration
institution to administer the arbitration, they will be responsible
for organizing the arbitration.

Where arbitration is conducted in Singapore, the Arbitration Act
(where all the parties are domestic) and the International
Arbitration Act (all other arbitrations) will apply.

**Arbitration For Small Cases**

**Small Claims Tribunal (SCT)**

The Small Claims Tribunals was established to provide a quick and
inexpensive forum for the resolution of small claims between
consumers and suppliers. Claims brought before the tribunals first
go through mediation to try to reach a settlement, failing which
adjudication is used to resolve the dispute.

Small Claims Tribunal can hear only (i) matters less than \$10,000;
or
\(ii) matters between \$10,000 and \$20,000, but only if all parties
signed a memorandum of consent to have the matter heard at the SCT.

**Law Society Arbitration Scheme (LSAS)**

The LSAS offers neutral evaluation and arbitration services under a
simple procedure designed to achieve a speedy resolution at
low cost.

Arbitrations with a sum in dispute of less than S\$60,000 are
‘documents-only’ arbitrations without an oral hearing, by default,
unless parties opt otherwise. Costs are limited to 10% of claim
value or S\$2,000, whichever is higher. A scale for party and party
costs also applies.

**Pro Bono Arbitration Scheme (PBAS)**

This scheme is similarly managed by the Law Society. The PBAS is
only for disputes of up to \$20,000, and arbitrations are conducted
on a documents-only basis.

There is a sole arbitrator, who will waive his or her fees for
the matter.

### Industry-Specific ADR Schemes

**Construction - BCA-SMC Adjudication Initiative**

The Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (SOP) Act was
introduced with the objective of facilitating cash flow in the
construction industry by upholding the rights of parties to seek
progress payment for work done, and providing a framework for quick and
low-cost resolution of payment disputes through adjudication. The Act
applies to all parties in the construction industry with written
contracts for the works or the supply of goods or services for
construction projects in Singapore.

The Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) has been appointed as the
Authorised Nominating Body or ANB under the Act and is tasked with
administering the adjudication process as well as train, certify and
maintain a register of adjudicators.

**Maritime - Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA)**

The SCMA offers parties involved in maritime disputes an independent,
efficient and reliable means of resolving their disputes through
arbitration. SCMA has an international panel of experienced arbitrators,
user-friendly arbitration rules and a quantum-based fee structure which
provides certainty of cost. Services provided by SCMA include
appointment of arbitrators and case administration including all
financial, logistical and administrative matters relating to the
arbitration.

**Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV)**

The SISV Dispute Resolution Centre provides mediation and arbitration
services in respect of real estate and construction disputes. The
mediators on SISV's Panel of Mediators are drawn from its membership.
They comprise practising quantity surveyors, valuers and land surveyors
who are familiar with the kinds of disputes in their respective
industries. Any party to a real estate or construction dispute may
approach the SISV Mediation Centre for its dispute to be resolved
through mediation. Disputes that can be handled by SISV include those
relating to:

- Construction contracts between developers and contractors, and between contractors and contractors.
- The development and management of buildings including strata title developments.
- The buying and selling of property and agency related disputes.
- The surveying field, including those concerning boundary conflicts and encroachments.

  project management, valuation, property management and
  maintenance issues concerning property and projects.

**For Disputes Between Law Practices – SCMediate**

Senior Counsel in private practice (known as the Forum of
Senior Counsel) have decided to make themselves available to mediate
disputes between law practices. Under this service, every Senior
Counsel in private practice will be available, if requested, to act
as a mediator in any dispute between law practices. The Senior
Counsel providing this service will not charge where the total time
spent does not exceed half a day. However, their availability to act
will be subject to their prior or overriding commitments. All
communications with Senior Counsel as mediator will be
kept confidential. Senior Counsel will render their services on the
basis that they will be exempted from liability in respect of the
services provided. As with all mediations, Senior Counsel will not
have any power to make binding decisions.

Parties may appoint a mutually agreed Senior Counsel of their choice
as mediator.

This scheme is different from the Cost Dispute Resolve scheme
offered by the society for resolving disputes on legal costs.

The CASE Mediation Centre helps settle disputes that often arise
between businesses and consumers by way of mediation rather than
through the courts.

**Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (FIDReC)**

The FIDReC is an independent and impartial institution specialising
in the resolution of disputes between financial institutions
and consumers. FIDReC subsumes the work of the Consumer Mediation
Unit (CMU) of the Association of Banks in Singapore and the
Insurance Disputes Resolution Organisation(IDRO). FIDReC provides an

**Law Society’s Cost Dispute Resolve**

Cost Dispute Resolve provides a simple and expedited arbitration
procedure for resolving the dispute if mediation is unsuccessful.
Under this scheme, the rules governing the mediation process and the
procedures have been kept simple to facilitate access
dispute resolution.

### Social, Community & Relational Disputes

**Community Mediation Centres (CMCs)**

The purpose of the CMC is to provide mediation services in social,
community or family disputes that do not involve a seizable offence
(where police are legally empowered to arrest without a warrant).

CMCs handle cases involving conflicts between neighbours, family members
and friends. CMCs cater to community disputes as opposed to commercial
ones. These encompass relational disputes encountered within one's
community and social sphere. Parties to:

-   Neighbourhood disputes
-   Family disputes (excluding family violence)
-   Disagreements with friends
-   Stallholder/owner squabbles and
-   Altercations/arguments between strangers

can approach the Community Mediation Centres. Staff will evaluate
the suitability of each case for mediation.

Apart from direct intake cases, the CMCs also handle Magistrate
Complaint referrals from the State Courts pursuant to section 15 of
the CMCs Act. CMCs have also worked with other frontline agencies
such as family service centres, community centres and the police to
set up satellite mediation venues at suitable locations near to
where Singaporeans live and work.

**Other Mediation and Counselling Centres**

Mediation work for family and community-related issues is also
undertaken by non-profit organisations in Singapore. For example,
the Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre (EMCC) conducts
community mediation and counseling programmes for individuals,
families, youths and organisations.

**Mediation in Family and Divorce Matters, Ministry of Community
Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS)**

Mediation is also used to resolve disputes in the Tribunal of
Maintenance of Parents (TMP) and the Syariah Court under MCYS.

The **TMP** provides a legal avenue for elderly parents to apply for a
maintenance order against their children. When a case is brought to the
TMP, the Tribunal first refers parties to a conciliation officer for
mediation, to try to help them arrive at a settlement.

In the **Syariah Court**, mediation is also used to help married couples
of the Muslim faith in filing for divorce issues such as the custody of
children, division of matrimonial property and other divorce and
ancillary issues. This helps the couple to maintain ties and continue to
communicate after the divorce for the sake of their children.
