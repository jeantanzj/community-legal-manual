# Juvenile Issues

## Definitions & Age Ranges

### Definitions

**Child (&lt; 14):** A “child” in Singapore is defined in the Children
and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38) as “a person who is below the age of 14
years”. [^1]

**Juvenile (7 to &lt;16):** A “juvenile” in Singapore is defined in the
Act as “a male or female person who is 7 years of age or above and below
the age of 16 years”. [^2]

**Young person (14 to &lt;16):** A “young person” is defined in the Act
as “a person who is 14 years of age or above and below the age of 16
years”. [^3]

### Relevant Penal Code Provisions

**Absolute immunity from criminal liability (&lt; 7):** The Penal Code
(Cap. 224) provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a child
under 7 years of age.” [^4]

**Qualified immunity from criminal liability (&gt;7 to &lt;12):** The
Penal Code provides that “\[n\]othing is an offence which is done by a
child above 7 years of age and under 12, who has not attained sufficient
maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequence of his
conduct on that occasion.” [^5]

### Jurisdiction of the Youth Court (*formerly Juvenile Court*)

**By age**

Only a child, juvenile or young person (age to be determined at the date
of commencement of the hearing of the charge) may be brought before the
Juvenile Court to be tried for an offence. [^6]

The Act provides that “no child or young person \[i.e. nobody under 16
years of age\] shall be charged with or tried for any offence by court
of summary jurisdiction except a Juvenile Court”, [^7] unless:

-   He/she is jointly charged with another person who is 16 years of age
    or above [^8]
-   He/she is charged with any offence triable only by the High Court,
    and (a) the Public Prosecutor has not applied to the Juvenile Court
    to try such offence or (b), if the Public Prosecutor has made such
    an application, the legal representative of the child/young person
    has not consented to the offence being tried by the Juvenile Court.
    [^9]

### Types of cases/issues

The Juvenile Court, or the Juvenile Justice Division of the State
Courts, deals with: [^10]

-   Beyond Parental Control (“BPC”) cases
-   Juvenile Arrest Cases (“JAC”)
-   Care & Protection Order (“CPO”) cases

## Beyond Parental Control

### Basic Information

Beyond Parental Control (“BPC”) refers to a child or young person below
the age of 16 years who may be: [^11]

1. In persistent conflict with his/her parent(s) and school or other
authorities **and/or**
2.  Displaying at-risk behaviour.

There has usually been a breakdown in the relationship and communication
between the child/young person and his/her parent(s). It may result in
the inability of the parent(s) to exercise care and control over the
child/young person. In these circumstances, the parent(s) can apply to
the Juvenile Court for a BPC order. [^12]

**Requirement of Proof:** The Court only makes a BPC order if the parent
can prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the child is beyond
parental control. The parent will have to first go through Pre-Complaint
Counselling with the child. This is conducted by the Singapore
Children's Society at the Juvenile Court.

### Procedure For Parents

**Step 1: Lodging a complaint** [^13]

The parent can lodge a complaint at the Juvenile Court from 2pm to 4pm
on Fridays, except on public holidays.

To lodge a complaint, the parent is required to bring their child along.
In the event that the parent is unable to do so, the Magistrate may
issue a warrant of arrest with no bail for the child to be brought to
the Juvenile Court.

The parent must bring the following documents:

-   The child’s Birth Certificate (either the original or photocopy).
-   The child’s Identity Card, if possible.
-   The Custody and Access Order, if the parents are divorced.

**Step 2: Pre-complaint counselling**

Before the complaint is sworn, the parents and the child will be
attended to by a Social Worker from the Singapore Children's Society who
will try to resolve the matter without the intervention of the Court.
[^14] In the meantime, the case will be adjourned for 4 weeks pending
the outcome of the counselling sessions. [^15]

In the event that Court intervention is still necessary, the Magistrate
will confirm that the parent is proceeding with the complaint before
calling for a Social Report on the child. Pending the preparation of the
Social Report, the Court may remand the child either in a Place of
Detention (either the Singapore Boys’ Home or the Toa Payoh Girls’
Home). [^16]

The parent will be informed of the date to return to Court when the
Court will make the appropriate orders. [^17]

**Step 3: Return to Court** [^18]

The parent must bring the child along on the return date. The Magistrate
and 2 Panel Advisers to the Juvenile Court will discuss and consider the
Social Report on the child.

Subject to the parent’s consent, the child may be ordered to:

-   Be sent to an Approved Home for not less than 2 and not more than 3
    years; or
-   Be placed on statutory supervision under the supervision of a Social
    Worker for a specified period not exceeding 3 years.

**Step 4: Consequences of breaching an order**

**Breach proceedings**

If the child fails to comply with any of the given orders, the Social
Worker will initiate breach proceedings against the child.

If the child is not in Court, a warrant of arrest will be issued. When
the warrant is executed and the juvenile is brought before the Court,
the Court will explain the substance of the complaint and elicit a reply
from the child and parent.

The Magistrate will call for a progress report on the child and fix a
date to consider the outcome of the breach. The child may be remanded
pending the production of the progress report.

**Court orders**

If the child is a resident of an Approved Home, the Court may order the
child to be transferred to another Approved Home and be detained there
for the whole or any part of the unexpired period of detention.

If the child is under statutory supervision, the Court may, on the
hearing date, make the following orders after considering the Social
Report and that it is in the best interest of the child to do so:

-   Discharge the child back to the parent.
-   Make a fresh statutory supervision order.
-   Order the child to be sent to an Approved Home for a minimum of 2
    years and a maximum of 3 years.

### Commonly Asked Questions On Going Beyond Parental Control

**Will the Juvenile Court be monitoring the child?**

The Juvenile Court does review BPC cases from time to time if there is a
need for close monitoring of the Juvenile. If and when the
pre-delinquent Child or Young Person fails to comply with an order of
statutory supervision, the Social Worker from Singapore Children's
Society may institute a complaint in Court. The juvenile and his Parents
are given an opportunity to explain and respond to these complaints. The
Court may remand the juvenile pending a progress report.

**Are there any programmes in place for BPC children/young persons?**

The Counselling And Psychological Services (“CAPS”) of the State Courts
introduced the BPC Family Conferencing programme to strengthen family
units, empower parents and the community to regain control of the
juveniles, encourage the juvenile to take responsibility for his
behaviour, reduce the placement of such juveniles in institutions
accommodating offenders and reduce the likelihood of the juvenile
committing an offence.

**Can the child or ex-spouse appeal the Court Order?**

Any child or young person or his parent or guardian who is dissatisfied
with any judgment or order of a Juvenile Court may appeal to the High
Court, in accordance with the provision of any law regulating appeals to
the High Court from a Magistrate’s Court (such as deadlines). [^19]

## Youth Arrest Cases

Case Flow Outline [^20]

![juvenile-case-flow](assets/juvenile-case-flow.jpeg)

The details on specific stages in the Case Flow Outline can be found in
the following sections. Refer to the relevant sections in this chapter
for more information on the Pre-Sentence Report stage, Court Orders, and
the Family Conferencing stage.

## Commonly Asked Questions on Pre-Sentence Report

### General Questions

**What is a Pre-Sentence Report?**

A Pre-Sentence Report is a report that gives information to the Court
about the juvenile and whether he/she can benefit from being placed on
probation under the supervision of a Probation Officer. The Report is
put up when the Court calls for it after a juvenile has been convicted
of an offence, and before the sentence or order is imposed.

**Why does the Court order a Pre-Sentence Report?**

The Pre-Sentence Report will help the Court understand the needs of the
juvenile and determine whether probation is in his/her best interest to
help him/her make positive changes. It should be noted that while the
Probation Officers make recommendations on the juvenile's suitability
for probation, it is ultimately the Court that decides on the sentence
or order. Besides calling for a Pre-Sentence Report, the Court can also
call for other reports such as medical or psychological reports.

**Who prepares the Pre-Sentence Report?**

The Pre-Sentence Report is prepared by trained Probation Officers from
MSF or volunteers who have been qualified as Gazetted Volunteer
Probation Officers. These officers are gazetted under the Probation of
Offenders Act.

### For Juvenile Offenders

**What does the offender have to do if told that a Pre-Sentence Report
will be prepared?**

Once the Court calls for a Pre-Sentence Report, the offender will have
to proceed to the Probation Intake Office on the 5th floor of the
Subordinate Courts' Complex to provide the Court Liaison Officer with
basic information to help them gather the relevant information about the
offender.

The Probation Officer will contact the offender and his parents/guardian
within 3 working days from the court appearance to arrange for an
interview. If the offender does not hear from the Probation office by
then, he may call the info-line at 1800-258-7963 to make enquiries. The
offender will be required to provide his I/C number to help the
Probation officer trace his case file.

**What will the Probation Officer ask?**

The Probation Officer will speak to the offender about his lifestyle,
family background, education and/or employment history, hobbies,
friends, any previous Court appearances and all the circumstances
surrounding the offence(s).

The officer may also want to talk to other people who know the offender,
such as family members, teachers or employers, counsellors (if any) who
may have counselled the offender in the past or any relevant persons. It
is important that the offender be truthful and co-operate with the
Probation Officer from the beginning to avoid a lengthy investigation
process.

## Court Orders

The Juvenile Court has the power to make orders for juveniles: [^21]

-   When an offence has been proven
-   When the juvenile admits the facts constituting the offence under
    Section 44(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act

### Considerations Of The Court [^22]

The Juvenile Court takes into consideration every individual offender’s
strengths and limitations when making its orders. In broad terms, the
factors that the Juvenile Court considers include:

-   Rehabilitation and reformation of the offender.
-   Removal of him/her from undesirable surroundings.
-   Promoting his/her education and welfare.
-   Compensation of victim(s) involved.
-   Protection of the public.
-   Minimising the risk of further offending by the offender.
-   Punishment of the offender.

**Step 1: Dealing with juvenile offenders** [^23]

The Juvenile Court is empowered with the following options (explained
below) to deal with a juvenile offender upon a finding of guilt under
Section 44 of the Act:

**(a) Discharging the offender**

The offender may be granted an absolute or conditional discharge. An
absolute discharge is rarely made. A conditional discharge is one where
the offender is discharged on condition that he does not commit any
offences within a prescribed period (maximum 12 months). The offender
may be conditionally discharged upon his entering into a bond to ensure
good behaviour.

**(b) Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other fit
person**

The Court may commit the offender to the care of a relative or fit
person for aspecified period of time if it deems that the offender will
be better cared for and supervised by that relative or fit person.

**(c) Offender's parent or guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
care and guardianship**

This order is usually made in conjunction with a Probation Order. An
appropriate monetary value ordered by the Magistrate will constitute the
bond.

**(d) Community service order**

The Court may require the offender to perform community service for a
specified duration of to 240 hours. This order is usually made in
conjunction with a Probation Order.

**(e) Probation order**

A probation order places the offender under the supervision of a
Probation Officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development
(“MSF”) for a period of not less than 6 months and not more than 3
years.

**Conditions and requirements**

The Court may attach conditions to the probation order that it thinks
necessary for securing the good conduct of the offender or preventing
him from re-offending. Such additional conditions can include residence
in an Approved Institution.

An additional requirement for residence is normally made for juveniles
who have an unsatisfactory home environment but who otherwise satisfy
the usual requirements for probation. The maximum duration of residence
at an Approved Institution is 12 months. Probationers who are ordered to
reside at an approved institution are permitted to work or pursue their
education in schools outside the confines of the institution after an
initial period of one month at the institution.

The following institutions are gazetted as Approved Institutions:

-   Singapore Boys’ Hostel (for males only)
-   Bukit Batok Hostel (for older males who are aged above 16 but placed
    on probation before turning 16)
-   Salvation Army Gracehaven (for non-Muslim females only)
-   Pertapis Adolescent Development Centre (for Muslim males only)
-   Pertapis Centre For Women and Girls (for Muslim females only)
-   Muhammiyah Welfare Home (for Muslim females only)

The Court may also make an order of residence in a non-gazetted home if
the pre-sentence report shows that the institution is prepared to accept
the offender. The Hiding Place, Singapore Boys’ Town and Teen Challenge
are voluntary institutions that accept male juveniles with delinquency
problems that are not deep-seated. At Teen Challenge, the programme that
the probationer has to undergo lasts 18 months.

**Classification of probation orders**

Operationally, probation orders have been classified into 3 grades to
cater for the varying intensity of risks and needs of the individual
probationers. These are:

-   Administrative Probation
-   Supervised Probation
-   Intensive Probation

**Additional orders**

These orders may be made in addition to the probation order:

-   Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other
    fit person.
-   Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
    care and Guardianship.
-   Community service order.
-   Detention at a Place of Detention (if detention order is made with
    Probation order, detention will be up to 3 months).
-   Weekend Detention at a Place of Detention or Approved Institution
    (up to 52 weekends).
-   Payment of a fine, damages or costs.

**(f) Detention at a “Place of Detention”**

The offender may be detained for a period of up to 6 months. The
following are gazetted as Places of Detention:

-   Singapore Boys’ Home (for males only)
-   Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (for females only)

Under this order, offenders will be required to be resident at the Place
of Detention for a specified period of time as ordered by the Court.

The following orders may also be made in addition to the Detention at a
Place of Detention order:

-   Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
    care and Guardianship
-   Probation order

**(g) Weekend detention at a “Place of Detention” or Approved
Institution**

The Court may order that the offender be detained in a Place of
Detention or an Approved Institution over a specified number of weekends
– up to 52 weekends. During the specified period, the offender is able
to pursue his/her education or go to work and attend school during the
weekdays.

However, they will be detained at Singapore Boys’ Home (for males only)
or Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (for females only) during the weekends from 3pm
on Saturday to 5pm on Sunday for the specified number of weekends.

The following orders may be made in addition to the Weekend Detention
order:

-   Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other fit
    person
-   Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
    care and Guardianship
-   Community service order
-   Probation order
-   Payment of a fine, damages or costs

**(h) Approved School order**

The Juvenile Court may commit offenders to an Approved School. Such
orders areusually meted out for juveniles with pronounced delinquency.
Juveniles who commit serious offences, exhibit a cavalier attitude
towards community-based supervision or have strong associations with
highly undesirable peers are normally sent to an Approved School regime
for a period of not more than 3 years.

This regime provides a structured and controlled environment in which to
rehabilitate the offender. There are facilities in all Approved Schools
to cater either "in-house" or outside the institution depending on the
offender's behaviour, to the offender's academic or vocational needs.
Depending on their behaviour and responses to the rehabilitation
programmes, residents in these institutions may be granted home leave
during weekends and be allowed to return to their schools and employment
after a period of initial stay, which is usually about 9 months.

**Approved Schools**

Both voluntary welfare organisations (“VWOs”) and MSF manage Approved
Schools.

There are presently two Approved Schools run by VWOs that meet the
specific rehabilitative needs of the offenders. These are:

-   Salvation Army, Gracehaven (for non-Muslims)
-   Muhammadiyah Welfare Home (for Muslims)

There are presently two Approved Schools run by MSF. These are:

-   Singapore Boys’ Home (“SBH”) (for males)
-   Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (“TPGH”) (for females)

Juveniles who are sent to SBH or TPGH exhibit a greater degree of
delinquency and possess more/greater risk factors compared to those sent
to Salvation Army Gracehaven or Muhammadiyah Welfare Home.

**(i) Reformative Training Centre**

The Prisons Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs runs the
Reformative Training Centre. Offenders here do not enjoy the privilege
of home-leave.

Where the offender is between the ages of 14 and 16, or has attained 16
years, and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to
his/her reformation that he/she should undergo a period of training in a
reformative training centre, it may order him to be brought before a
District Court to be considered for reformative training.

This order is normally made after the juvenile has committed a breach
for unruly behaviour in an Approved School regime.

**(j) Payment of a fine, damages or costs**

Offenders may be asked to make reparation to society by way of a fine or
to the victim by an award of damages. This order is rarely made alone
and is normally coupled with a probation order.

In the case of a child (below 14 years old) or young person (14 years
old and above, but below 16 years old), the parents/guardians will be
ordered to pay this on behalf of the child. Such an order will not be
made against the parents/guardians if the Court is satisfied that the
parents/guardians cannot be found or that they have not conduced the
commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care over the
child/young person.

**Stage 2: Review of cases** [^24]

**(a) Court-ordered probation review**

Apart from the 6-monthly reviews, the Juvenile Court may decide to place
selected probation cases for review very shortly after making the
probation order. The period could be 1 to 3 months after the probation
order. This is to ensure that such cases are very closely monitored and
remedial actions enforced should the probationer manifest any intention
not to cherish the opportunity to be rehabilitated.

**(b) Advisory Board review**

Residents' progress in the Approved Schools and Approved Homes regime
are assessed at the meetings of the Advisory Board, a body constituted
by the Minister of Community Development and Sports to review such
residents. Such meetings are held once every 2 months. The Juvenile
Court Magistrate is an ex officio member of this Board. The Director of
Social Welfare, on the advice of the Advisory Board, may release the
residents on licence after they have completed 12 months in the Approved
Schools / Approved Homes regime.

**Stage 3 (if applicable): Breach of Court Order** [^25]

Residents in the Approved Schools and Approved Homes may be in breach
for unruly behaviour. The test is whether the resident is so unruly a
character that he/she cannot be so detained in the Approved School or
Home. Such behaviour includes bullying other residents, fighting and
abscondance. The manager of a Place of Detention, an Approved School or
an Approved Home can initiate breach proceedings against a resident, to
the Juvenile Court.

The resident is offered an opportunity to explain himself or engage a
counsel to do so to the Court. The Court, if satisfied that there is
justification for the breach action, will call for a progress report on
the resident and fix the case for consideration before the Juvenile
Court.

If the Juvenile Court is satisfied that the Young Person is so unruly as
to be unfit to reside at the present institution, it is empowered to
mete out the following orders pursuant to Section 44(7) of the Children
and Young Persons Act:

-   Order the resident to be transferred to another Approved School that
    the Court considers more suitable, and detain the resident there for
    the unexpired period of detention (for example, an unruly female
    resident may be transferred from the Salvation Army Gracehaven to
    the Toa Payoh Girls' Home).
-   If a resident is between 14 and 16 years of age, he/she may be
    brought before a District Court and sent to the Reformative
    Training Centre.

However, it is also open to the Court in the appropriate case to give
the young person a stern warning with respect to his behaviour and
direct him to continue his present detention.

## Family Conferencing

Under Section 45(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, the Juvenile
Court Magistrate may order that a juvenile case conference be convened
to deal with an offender found guilty of an offence. This order is made
if in respect of the offender's family background, general conduct, home
surroundings, school record, medical history and state of development of
the offender, the Court is satisfied that it would be in the best
interests of the offender that he/she be dealt with by a juvenile case
conference. [^26]

### Participants

The parties convened by the Magistrate will vary according to the needs
of each juvenile case conference. The participants of a conference may
include the following:

-   Facilitator
-   Offender
-   Parent(s) or guardian(s)
-   Extended family
-   Victim(s)
-   Victim’s family
-   Offender’s school teacher, principal and/or employer
-   Prosecutor and/or Police Investigating Officer
-   Probation (Welfare) Officer, Case Worker and/or Psychologist
-   Other relevant persons.

### Objectives [^27]

Objectives of these juvenile case conferences include:

-   Reprimanding the offender.
-   Administering a formal caution to the offender.
-   Requiring the offender to pay compensation to the victim(s) of
    the offence.
-   Requiring the offender to apologise to the victim(s) of the offence.
-   Resolving any relationship problems between the child/young person
    and the parent/guardian, which should aid the rehabilitation of
    the juvenile.
-   Requiring the offender to do such other acts as the juvenile case
    conference thinks appropriate in the circumstances.

### Court Orders

The results and recommendations of the juvenile case conference are made
to the Magistrate who then makes appropriate orders in open Court. If it
is deemed appropriate, under Section 46(1) of the Act the Court may make
an additional order requiring either or both the child/young person and
the parent/guardian thereof to undergo counselling, psychotherapy or
other appropriate programmes.

After the conference, you and your child will wait at the waiting area
of the Juvenile Court before the case is mentioned in the Juvenile
Court. The Magistrate will then make an order on your child's case. The
options available to the Court are:

-   Discharge
-   Discharge with good behaviour bond
-   Commit to a relative or fit person for a specified period
-   Parent/guardian to enter bond to exercise proper care and
    supervision
-   Probation
-   Detention in a Place of Detention (up to 6 months)
-   Approved School order (between 2-3 years)
-   Fine, damages, or costs
-   Transfer to a District Court for a reformatory training order, if it
    is expedient to your child's reformation that such an order is made
    (certain conditions will have to be met before such an order is made
    if your child is above 14 years old and below 16 years old)

## Commonly Asked Questions on Court Orders & Family Conferencing

**How does the offender appeal a court order?**

Any child/ young person or his parent/guardian who is dissatisfied with
any judgment or order of a Juvenile Court may appeal to the High Court.
[^28]

Appeals must be in accordance with the provision of any law in force for
the time being regulating appeals to the High Court from a Magistrate’s
Court, [^29] which means that the appeal must be filed with the Crime
Registry of the State Courts within 14 days from the time the judgment,
sentence or order is made. [^30]

**How can a parent help the child remain on the right track after the
Court Order?**

The real test on the child's sincerity for change comes after the Court
has made an order for his/her case. The child needs to have the
determination for a change as well as your continued support. Be
sensitive to the child's needs but keep boundaries and rules intact.

Attending parenting workshops and talks may be useful. A parent can get
a copy of these from the information counter of the Family Court,
various social service centres, family service centres or from the
Ministry of Social and Family Development. Counselling for the parent
and child at various family service centres will also assist in the
child's rehabilitative needs.

**What happens at the Juvenile Case Conference?**

Knowing that the child has committed an offence can be a difficult or
embarrassing thing to accept for many parents. Sometimes the juveniles
may not know how their parents feel about their offence, the impact it
has on a victimor the level of responsibility needed for wayward
actions. There is a need for confrontation, reprimand, reconciliation,
and resolution of key issues or counselling which furthers
rehabilitation.

The Juvenile Court is not only a Court that metes out punishment for
crime but also focuses on the restoration of an offender and his / her
family. Restorative justice aims towards the ultimate reintegration of a
sound young person into a functional family.

Together with the juvenile and his/her family, participants will examine
the formulation of the rehabilitation process including the possible
commencement of additional counselling, psychotherapy or other programme
deemed appropriate in future.

The facilitator guides, sums up and closes the conference. Ultimately,
it is the Magistrate of Juvenile Court itself who decides on all orders
to be imposed.

**How effective is a Juvenile Case Conference?**

Between 1994 and 2000, 144 cases underwent Family Conferencing (as it
was called then). 53% of them were for thefts. Only a mere 6% reoffended
over this period, with no records of re-offending in some years. The
study showed that the juvenile's family members, his/her extended
family, and his/her schoolteachers contributed to his/her
rehabilitation.

In two studies in 1995 and 1997, surveys were conducted to evaluate the
impact of Family Conferencing on juvenile offenders and their family
members. The results showed that both juveniles and their family members
have benefited from the programme. In many cases, the juvenile and his
family realised the seriousness of his offending behaviour. The Family
Conference offered the offender an opportunity to accept responsibility
qua the victim. The offender and his Parents improved their relationship
with one another. Parents also indicated that Family Conferencing helped
them realise the needs of the juveniles. With the aid of the
facilitators they were able to identify areas to work on.

## Restorative Programmes

### Counselling And Psychological Services (CAPS)

The CAPS of the State Courts coordinates and brings together the formal
and informal juvenile justice constituents in the rehabilitation of the
juvenile offender and youths at risk. It works out programmes for
juveniles and their families with an emphasis to re-integrate the
juvenile back to his/her family and community in line with the
Restorative Justice Model adopted by the Juvenile Justice System. [^31]

Personal and specialised attention is paid to each juvenile offender,
his character, his family and environment for a holistic approach to
rehabilitation. In additionCAPS, in its planning of restorative
programmes, also looks at the larger issue of educating the general
public and community on pertinent issues that underscore delinquency and
crime recidivism. [^32]

Programmes established should not only teach juvenile delinquents and
offenders basic life skills and afford them employability and
self-sustenance without resorting to crime. In addition, the juvenile's
family and community of care should be targeted as well. Thus the
Juvenile Court, CAPS and its constituent stakeholders actively seek to
tap all available community resources as meaningful options that targets
at underlying causes of delinquency, resulting in meaningful
re-orientation of values and eroding causes of recidivism. The approach
seeks to equip young offenders and delinquents with the resources and
life skills to embark on more constructive lifestyles. [^33]

### Streetwise Programme [^34]

The Streetwise Programme is a government-funded project initiated by the
Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime and is coordinated by the
National Youth Council (“NYC”). There are 4 youth agencies which work in
collaboration with the NYC in administering this programme.

The Juvenile Court refers certain offenders to this developmental
programme as a condition of their probation which aims at changing the
behaviour of youths who have unwittingly drifted into gangs. It is an
intensive 6-month structured programme that incorporates elements of
counselling, family conferencing, peer support, recreation and academic
activities. The programme aims to help these youths “turn their lives
around” and gain a fresh start.

### Youth Family Care Programme [^35]

The Youth Family Care ("YFC") Programme is run by CAPS and the Singapore
Children's' Society. A large number of delinquent youths who come under
the supervision of the Juvenile Court come from broken and dysfunctional
families where there are often no adequate family role models. Through
YFC, volunteer Mentor Families are matched to befriend, mentor, support
and encourage young persons placed on probation or statutory supervision
as well as to provide hope and modelling for healthy families that work.
It is targeted at helping juvenile offenders and children who are beyond
parental control who have little family support, who are remorseful
about their past misdeeds and do not have ingrained delinquent traits.

### Beyond Parental Control Family Conferencing [^36]

The Beyond Parental Control ("BPC") Family Conferencing philosophy is
similar to that of the Family Conferencing for offenders except that it
is targeted at juveniles who are BPC. It was introduced to strengthen
family units, empower parents and the community to regain control of the
juveniles, encourage the juvenile to take responsibility for his
behaviour, reduce the placement of such juveniles in institutions
accommodating offenders and reduce the likelihood of the juvenile
committing an offence.

### School-Probation-Courts Link-Up [^37]

This programme, implemented on 1 July 2000, institutionalizes the role
of Operations Managers ("OMs") in schools within the rehabilitative
framework of a Probation Order. OMs hold non-teaching posts in schools
and handle school administrative operations including disciplinary
issues. Under this programme, the OM will be the contact person for all
probationers' matters, including contributing or assisting the Probation
Officer during the pre-sentence investigation stage and drawing up the
supervision plan should probation be granted. This improves the
communication and follow-up channels between the schools and the Courts
in probation matters.

### Peer Mediation Programme [^38]

The philosophy behind introducing peer mediation in schools is to nip
disciplinary problems in the bud before they escalate into behaviour
that requires intervention by schools, police or the Courts. This is
done by imparting practical skills to students in the management and
resolution of conflicts. Selected students receive special training to
enable them to act as third party mediators between two or more of their
peers in the same school who are involved in petty quarrels and who are
willing to have their disputes resolved constructively.

Those collaborating in the Peer Mediation programme encompass a wide
range of community and government organizations, including schools,
CDCs, namely Sembawang-Hong Kah CDC and Ang Mo Kio-Cheng San CDC, the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Law, the Community Mediation
Centres and the Law Society.

## Care & Protection

### Duty Of Parents

Parents have a duty to provide care and protection to their children.
This includes providing a safe home environment, provision of food,
clothes and shelter. They also have a duty under law to provide for the
child’s education.

Section 68 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) provides that *“\[e\]xcept
where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the
duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or
her children:*

-   *Whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other
    person, and*
-   *Whether they are legitimate or illegitimate,*

*either by*

-   *Providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and
    education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and
    station in life or*
-   *By paying the cost thereof.”*

### Information For Juveniles Seeking Help Or Advice

If a child or young person requires help and advice because basic care
and protection is not provided at home, he can approach his teachers or
counsellors in school or a Family Service Centre. They may help him to
talk to his parents and help him and his parents to understand one
another.

If the problem cannot be resolved, the person whom the child or young
person can ask for help may report the case to the Ministry of Social
and Family Development (“MSF”). A social worker from the MSF will:

* Remove the child or young person from his home to a place of safety if
  the worker thinks it is not safe living at home;
* Check to see whether the child or young person is being properly taken
  care of at home;
* Counsel the parents and teach them how to take better care of the
  child or young person, and/or;
* Apply to the Juvenile Court for a Care and Protection Order if necessary.

### Role Of The Juvenile Court

The Court will act in the youth’s best interest, and may order that:

* A welfare officer supervise him/her, to ensure he/she is well taken care of by his/her parents;
* The youth stay in a Home for boys and/or girls, or a relative or other person
  who can take good care of him/her, and/or;
* The youth and his/her parents to go for counselling, psychotherapy or
  other programmes so as to teach them how to deal with the problems
  each party faces and to teach the parents how to take better care of their child.

The MSF social worker will contact the parents to inform them of their
legal duty to allow the youth to continue his/her studies. If necessary,
the social worker will apply for a Care and Protection Order that can
help keep the youth in school.

### Domestic Violence

**Family violence**

Domestic or family violence can occur in different forms. Examples
include punching, slapping, kicking, choking, hitting with objects,
issue of threats, intimidation and verbal abuse. [^39]

Under Section 64 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), “family violence”
means the commission of any of the following acts:

1. Wilfully / knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family
member in fear of hurt.
2. Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought
to have been known would result in hurt.
3. Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will.
4. Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it
is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

This does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way
of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

**Information for victims of family violence**

If a person or any of his family members are victim(s) of
domestic/family violence, the person should immediately:

**(a) Go to the Police for help**

The person can call the police or go to the nearest neighbourhood Police
Post or Centre for help. A police report is necessary if the person
wishes to apply for a Protection or Expedited Order. The police can
provide a referral letter to go to the hospital for medical examination
and treatment.

**(b) Go to a Family Service Centre for advice and assistance**

The person can call any of the hotlines or go to the nearest family
service centre for help or the person needs someone to talk to. There
will be people to listen and assist.

**(c) Go for a medical examination/treatment if injured**

A person should seek medical treatment at the nearest hospital or
clinic. Even if there is no wish to take action against the abuser, it
is advisable that the person go to the doctor to have his injuries
documented as evidence of the abuse.

**(d) Go to a temporary shelter if the person fears for own safety or
the safety of his family members**

**(e) Go to a crisis shelter**

If a person has to leave the home immediately due to family violence and
have no place to go, there are crisis shelters where he can stay
temporarily. The person may approach a Family Service Centre or the
Police if he wishes to go to a crisis shelter. The person can also seek
shelter with relatives or friends whom he can trust.

**(f) Go to the Family Court for a Protection Order or Expedited Order**

You can apply to the Court for:

-   A Protection Order to stop the family violence
-   An Expedited Order if there is imminent danger of family violence
    being committed against the applicant or the applicant’s
    family member.

These are “restraining orders” that forbid the abusive member from using
violence against the applicant. Not abiding by the order is a criminal
offence that can be charged in court.

A person can apply for a Protection Order / Expedited Order from the
Family Court on his own if he is 21 years old and above. If the affected
person is below 21 years old, he must get a relative who is 21 years old
or above to make the application for him.
