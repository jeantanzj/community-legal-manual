# Wills, Intestacy, Probate and Administration

## Making a Will [^1]

### What is a Will?

A Will is a legal document by which a person writing the Will ("the
Testator") can, amongst other things -

1.  Dictate how his/her assets shall be administered and distributed
    after his/her death. The recipients of these assets are known as
    "beneficiaries";
2.  Appoint a person ("the Executor") to carry out such administration
    and distribution upon the Testator’s death; and
3.  Appoint guardians for his/her children who may still be under the
    age of 21 at the Testator’s death.

### How is a Will Created?

There are certain basic requirements for a valid will -

1.  The Testator must be older than 21 years old;
2.  The Testator must have the requisite mental capacity to make the will;
3.  The will must be made in writing, and must be signed by the Testator
    in the presence of two (2) witnesses; and
4.  The witnesses to the execution of the will can be a Testator's
    lawyer, friend or relative (excluding spouse) as long as the witness
    is not a beneficiary under the will.

A maximum of four (4) people can be appointed as Executor/Trustee under
a will, although the more Executor/Trustees are appointed, the harder it
is for all of them to make a decision.

**Important note:** Under section 115(1) of the Administration of Muslim
Law Act, the beneficiaries must apply to the President of the Syariah
Court for an Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each
beneficiary. Muslims can only dispose off or give away 1/3 of their
estate to persons who are not already entitled under the Inheritance
Certificate mentioned above.

### What assets you can include in a Will?

Only assets that are under your sole name can be passed on under a will,
although this includes any tenancies-in-common, which are divisible and
can be bequeathed.

Assets which cannot be included in a will are -

1.  Any immovable properties that are held in joint tenancy;
2.  Monies in Central Provident Fund;
3.  Insurance policies in which you have nominated beneficiaries.

### Money in your Central Provident Fund (CPF)

Under the laws of Singapore, the savings in your CPF Ordinary, Special,
Medisave and Retirement Account as well as any discounted SingTel Shares
cannot be distributed under your Will. Instead you will have to make a
nomination under the CPF Act.

Your nominee will then be entitled to the funds in your CPF account. If
you have not made a nomination, your funds will be distributed under the
law in accordance with the Intestate Succession.

If you get married after making a nomination, your nomination made
before marriage is automatically cancelled, unless you say that it was
made in contemplation of marriage. Therefore, you ought to make a new
nomination after marrying.

### Changing your Will

Never attempt to change your Will by crossing parts out or adding words
in or by attaching anything to it. If you do so your Will may become
ineffective or invalid. If you wish to change your Will, either make a
fresh Will or prepare a Supplemental Will (“a Codicil”).

### Reviewing your Will

If you marry or remarry, your Will is revoked unless the Will was made
in contemplation of your marriage.

You should also review your Will if any of the following happens:

1.  If you change your name or anyone mentioned in the Will changes his name;
2.  If an executor or trustee dies or becomes incapable of carrying out
    his duties owing to ill-health;
3.  If a beneficiary dies (this is called a “Lapse”);
4.  If you subsequently sell or part with any property mentioned in the Will, or;
5.  If there is any significant change in circumstances, for example, when
    you acquire property or assets which have not been mentioned in your Will.

It is advisable to review your Will regularly.

### Making known your Will

Although a Will is a private document, it is important that your family
and especially your executors know that you have a Will and where you
have kept it. You should submit an online deposit form to the Wills
Registry which is maintained by the Public Trustee. The Registry acts as
a central information centre for all wills that are drawn up, of which
notice has been given to the Public Trustee. The Wills Registry,
however, only keeps a record that you have done a Will and does not
actually keep a copy of the Will itself. You do not have to register the
Will in order to validate it.

This form can be downloaded from their website at
<https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/pto/en.html>.

Apart from registering your Will with the Wills Registry, you may wish
to deposit the original Will with your lawyer for safekeeping. You
should then give your executors your lawyer’s name and address.

### Administering your estate

Your Will takes effect upon your death. Your executors would have to
apply to Court for a Grant of Probate. The Court will only issue the
Grant after it is satisfied that all procedural requirements are met.
Estate Duty clearance will be required before a Grant is obtained for
deaths that took place before 15 February 2008.

Once the Grant of Probate is issued, the original Will is retained by
the Court. The executors will be given a copy of the Will together with
the Grant. All your property and assets will then pass to your
executors, who will have the responsibility of administering and
distributing the estate according to the instructions in your Will.

## If You Do Not Make A Will

If you pass away without making a Will, your assets will be distributed
according to the rules of intestacy as laid down in the Intestate
Succession Act. Your lawyer can advise you about these rules and how
they apply to you. If you die without making a Will, your estate may be
distributed to persons to whom you do not intend to give anything.

Also, if you pass away without making a Will, you cannot choose the
people who will look after your estate. Administrators, rather than
executors, will look after your estate, although they have the same
responsibilities. Administrators have to apply to Court for "Letters of
Administration" instead of the Grant of Probate and the procedure is
generally more complicated. For example, the administrators will have to
provide two guarantors unless they get approval from the Court.

Therefore, if you want to provide for your family members, friends or a
charity after your death, you should consider making a Will as it will
be easier and more convenient.

## Costs

If you are concerned about the cost of making a Will, discuss this with
your lawyer. You can ask your lawyer for an estimate of the costs
involved before appointing him.

## Syariah Law

Some of the points mentioned above do not apply to Muslims. Under
section 115(1) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, the
beneficiaries must apply to the President of the Syariah Court for an
Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each beneficiary.
Muslims can only dispose off or give away 1/3 of their estate to persons
who are not already entitled under the Inheritance Certificate mentioned
above.

## Commonly Asked Questions on Wills

### Do I need a lawyer?

If you are 21 years and of sound mind, you may make your own Will and
change it at any time during your life without consulting a lawyer. (s4
of the Wills Act) But the risk is that your home-made Will may be
ineffective or invalid, causing your beneficiaries to suffer unnecessary
expense. It is therefore in your interest to consult a lawyer who can
advise you and draft your Will for you according to law.

However, if you are a soldier in active military service, or a mariner
or a seaman at sea, you may make a Will even though you are under 21
years (s5 of the Wills Act).

### What will make a Will ineffective or invalid?

Your Will is invalid if it does not conform to the rules of formal
validity under the Wills Act:

-   A Will must be committed to writing (verbal declaration of the
    Testator’s intentions does not constitute a valid Will).
-   The testator must be at least 21 of age.
-   The testator must sign the Will at the foot of the Will. If the
    testator is unable to do so, he may direct another person to sign it
    in his presence.
-   A Will must be witnessed by two witnesses, and they must also sign
    the Will in the presence of the testator.
-   The two witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the Will, or spouses of
    the beneficiaries.

If you change your Will by crossing parts out or adding words in or by
attaching anything to it and not by making a fresh Will or prepare a
Supplemental Will (codicil), your Will may become ineffective or invalid
(s15 of the Wills Act).

If you marry or remarry, your Will is revoked unless the Will was made
in contemplation of your marriage (s13 of the Wills Act).

### What if I cannot afford a lawyer?

Normally, it costs around a few hundred Singapore dollars to engage a
lawyer to draft a Will. If it is not affordable for you, you may
consider obtaining free legal advice by visiting a Community Legal
Clinic, provided by the Pro Bono Service Office to clarify any queries
you may have on drafting a Will. For more information, you may refer to
the website of the Pro Bono Service Office [^2]. You may also find a
list of other legal clinics there.

If you require further services, you may consider applying to the Legal
Aid Bureau, which can assist in appointing a lawyer for you if you meet
their entry requirements. Ad Hoc Pro Bono Services by the Pro Bono
Service Office can also assist in putting you in touch with a lawyer who
is willing to take up the case on a pro bono basis.

### What will happen to assets I do not mention in my Will?

Where you pass away leaving behind a Will which does not deal with all
of your estate, those assets not disposed of in your Will will be
distributed in accordance with the rules under the Intestate Succession
Act. This situation is usually described as “partial intestacy”. For the
Intestate Succession Act, you may refer to the explanation “If You Do
Not Make A Will” above.

It is good to have an Inventory List of your Assets and Liabilities
attached to your Last Will in order to list down all the assets you own.
This will help your executor in the event of your death. You should also
update your Inventory List from time to time to reflect changes to your
asset list. Further, to avoid the status of “partial intestacy”, it is
crucial to include a “residuary clause” in your Will.

### What if someone doesn’t agree with my choice of beneficiaries?

You have a right to choose beneficiaries solely at your discretion in
your Will and can choose your family members, your friends or even an
organization as beneficiaries in your Will.

However, this right of choice of beneficiaries is subject to the
provisions of the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act where your
dependants can apply to Court for a reasonable provision of maintenance
from your estate even though they are not beneficiaries under your Will.
The Court has the power to order that your estate make payment to these
dependents either as a lump sum or on such terms that the Court deems
fit. Dependants which may be entitled to make such application are (s3
of the Inheritance Act):

-   A spouse.
-   An unmarried daughter
-   A son who has not attained his age of 21 years.
-   A son or a daughter who is in capable of maintaining himself or herself,
    by reason of some mental or physical disability.

### Is a hand-written will valid?

Yes, you can prepare a hand-written Will by hand since the Will Act does
not question the form of writing of a Will. A hand-written Will may be
valid as long as it is properly executed in accordance with the Wills
Act.

But, you should be aware that you still need to sign your Will in the
presence of witnesses and it is not possible to make a valid Will alone.

### Is a Will drafted overseas valid in Singapore?

Yes, even if a Will is drafted and executed overseas, it can be a valid
Will. However, the Will has to be executed according to:

-   The territory of execution of the Will.
-   The territory of domicile of the testator when the Will was executed
    or at the time of his death.
-   The territory of habitual residence of the testator when the Will
    was executed or at the time of his death: or
-   The territory of which the testator was a national when the Will was
    executed or at the time of his death.

### Can I draft a will on someone else’s behalf?

Yes. You can assist to draft a Will on another person’s behalf. However,
the person making the Will will have to be the person that signs at the
foot of the Will as the testator.

### How does someone who “lacks capacity” (eg. mental illness, etc) draft a will?

A person who lacks mental capacity will not be able to make a Will. The
Testator has to be of sound mind, and mentally capable of understanding
what he/she is doing and the consequences of that action, when making a
Will.

Hence, before a Will is executed, if there may be a dispute as to the
mental capacity of a testator, a medical report should be obtained to
substantiate that a person is of such sound mind as to be able to make a
Will. Sometimes, allegations of undue influence can also be asserted by
certain parties, on the Testator. Undue influence can refer to the
unconscientious use of one’s power over another, such as coercion,
threats, harassments or persistent persuasion.

However, people who are illiterate can still make a Will. If a Testator
cannot read or write, he can ask someone else to write down his
intention. If a testator cannot sign his name, he can affix his
thumbprint on the document. What matters is that the testator has the
mental capacity and understands that he is making a Will, and the
consequences of doing so.

### What happens to my debt? Who will inherit my mortgage, etc?

An administrator or an executor has to make payment of any debts and
expenses of the deceased prior to the distribution of his estate.

If there aren’t enough assets to cover the debts, the estate is said to
be insolvent. For insolvent estate, the order of priority in the
repayment of debts have to be accordance with the *First Schedule* of
the Probate and Administration Act, and then rules under the *Bankruptcy
Act* will follow. If there aren’t enough funds left over to pay all the
creditors in one group, the amount left will be prorated to creditors in
the group. The beneficiaries will also get nothing, even if a will
leaves them specific property or specified sums of money. Beneficiaries
can only receive assets in probate if there are enough assets left over
after all legitimate debts have been paid.\
On the other hand, in the case of a solvent estate, creditors will get
paid in the order found in the Second Schedule of the Probate and
Administration Act.

A creditor can also apply for the Letters of Administration as a
creditor where spouses or next of kin of the deceased do not apply.

### What about my CPF?

As stated above, distribution of assets of the deceased is generally
handled by an administrator or an executor.

However, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is different. CPF is a
comprehensive social security savings plan administered by the Singapore
government.Under the CPF Act, the savings in your CPF Ordinary, Special,
Medisave and Retirement Account as well as any discounted SingTel Shares
cannot be distributed under your Will. If a CPF member makes a
nomination under this Act, the CPF contributions made and death benefits
payable under the insurance scheme administered by the CPF Board will be
distributed to the nominees specified under the nomination without the
need for a Grant of Probate to be extracted for the member’s estate.

For more information about assets handled outside the power of an
Administrator or Executor, see “Administration of Small Estates by the
Public Trustee”.

### Do I have to disclose my criminal record or declare previous convictions when drafting a Will?

No. A Will is a private document wherein you dictate matters such as the
disposal of assets, and the guardianship of infant children. Thus, past
criminal record and previous convictions do not have to be disclosed
with making a Will.

### What if the deceased gives something away which they were not entitled to in the first place (eg. property in someone else’s name, etc)?

The testator can only dispose of assets under his name. Thus, if a
Testator gives something which does not belong to him/her in a Will,
such part of a Will will not have effect.\
Immovable property that is owned by you with another person in joint
tenancy is subject to the general rule of survivorship, wherein a joint
owner who survives is entitled to the whole ownership of the joint asset
once another joint owner passes away.

However, this rule does not apply if your immovable properties is held
in a “Tenancy-in-common”, where each of the joint owners owns an
identifiable share of the immovable property and can deal with his share
of the immovable property in his Will.\
The manner of holding and the specific share of each owner is stated on
the documents conferring the title of immovable property on the owners,
like the Certificate of Title.

## Administration of Small Estates by The Public Trustee [^3]

### Overview Of Services Provided By The Public Trustee

**Administration of Estates of Deceased Persons**

The Public Trustee administers small estates of deceased persons where
the value of the estate does not exceed \$50,000.00.

In administering an estate, the Public Trustee recovers and realizes
assets in the estate and distributes these to the beneficiaries. The
Public Trustee ascertains the beneficiaries according to the Intestate
Succession Act (Cap. 146) for non-Muslims and Administration of Muslim
Law Act (Cap. 3) for Muslims.

If the beneficiary is a minor, the Public Trustee will hold his share in
trust until he attains 21 years old. In the meantime, the minor
beneficiary’s guardian can apply to the Public Trustee for the child’s
monthly maintenance.

The assets that are administered by the Public Trustee include:

-   Deceased’s monies in banks or other financial institutions
    in Singapore.
-   Deceased’s shares which are listed on SGX.
-   Deceased’s vehicle, except taxis.
-   Deceased’s undrawn salary.
-   Compensation monies due to the deceased.

**Who Can Apply To the Public Trustee?**

Any person over 21 years old can apply. Friends or relatives can also
apply on behalf of beneficiaries.

**Statutory Fees Charged**

The statutory fees payable to the Public Trustee are as follows:


|  **Value of Estate**  | **Charge** |
|-----------------------|------------|
| For the first \$5,000 |    6.50%   |
| For the next \$2,000  |    6.00%   |
| For the next \$3,000  |    4.25%   |
| For the next \$10,000 |    2.75%   |
| For the next \$30,000 |    2.25%   |

These fees, which we will take from the estate money, include GST and
cannot be waived. You will have to pay a minimum fee of \$15.

**How To Apply To The Public Trustee To Be Administrator**

You will need to make an online application at
<https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/pto/en.html> under eServices for the
Public Trustee to administer the Deceased’s estate monies. Please note
that you will be required to disclose information on the Deceased’s
shares, bank savings account, death gratuity, insurance policies and
vehicles owned (if any) in the online application.

You will need to have your Singpass ready in order to access the online
application form. You may apply for your Singpass at
[<https://www.singpass.gov.sg>](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/) if you do
not have one.

If you are ineligible to apply for a Singpass, you may apply for a login
ID and password through the website:
<https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/pto/en.html> under eServices.

Please note that the information given to the public trustee must be
true.

It is an offence to furnish false information to a public servant.

The Public Trustee will not administer the estate if he discovers that
any information given is incorrect or untrue.

### Situations Where The Public Trustee Is Unable To Help

The situations where the Public Trustee is unable to assist include the
following:

-   Where the estate exceeds \$50,000 in value.
-   Where there are conflicting claims to the estate or disputes
    between beneficiaries.
-   Where the estate has outstanding debts or liabilities.
-   Where the deceased had shares or other interest in unlisted
    companies (foreign or local.
-   Where the deceased was a partner, a sole-proprietor or had interest
    in a firm or other business.
-   Where the deceased was the sole lessee (owner) of a HDB flat and
    there are minor interests.
-   Where there are pending law suits which involve the deceased.

Where the Public Trustee is unable to administer the estate, you may
have to apply to the Courts for Letters of Administration (i.e. appoint
administrators) to deal with the deceased’s estate. If you qualify for
legal aid, you may apply to the Legal Aid Bureau at The URA Centre, East
Wing, 45 Maxwell Road, \#07-11, Singapore 069118 to assist you to apply
for the Letters of Administration. If not, you will have to engage the
services of a lawyer.

### Administration Of CPF Funds Of Deceased Persons

The CPF Board will forward a Deceased’s CPF monies to the Public Trustee
under the following scenarios:

1. If the Deceased had not made a valid CPF nomination during his lifetime, or;
2. If the person nominated to receive the CPF monies is under 18 years old (other than a widow). 

You will need to check with CPF Board if the Deceased had made a valid
nomination for his CPF monies. If the Deceased had made a valid CPF
nomination, the CPF Board will pay out his CPF monies directly to the
nominee(s) if he/she is above 18 years old.

**Application To The Public Trustee**

You will need to make an online application at
<https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/pto/en.html> under eServices for the

## About the Wills Registry [^4]

**What is the Wills Registry?**

The Public Trustee maintains a confidential Wills Registry where
testators and their solicitors can deposit information on Wills. No
actual wills are deposited at the Wills Registry. All Wills must be kept
by the testator or his/her representative.

The will information will be kept in the system for 120 years from the
date of birth of the person making the will.

**What are the benefits of the Wills Registry?**

In the administration of a deceased’s estate, the administrator or
executor has to first determine whether the deceased left behind a Will.
Often, the next-of-kin or beneficiaries may also believe that the
deceased may have done so but do not have a copy of the Will or
information as to which solicitor drew up the Will.

The information available from the Wills Registry will be useful to the
following persons:

- The person who made the Will (also known as the testator) and/or
  his/her solicitors if the testator wishes to make a subsequent Will;

- The solicitors acting for the estate of the deceased testator to
  assist them in the administration of the deceased testator’s estate, **or**;

- The next-of-kin or beneficiaries of a deceased.

## Probate and Letters of Administration [^8]

**What happens to the property belonging to a person when he dies?**

A person has to be appointed by the Court to take charge of the deceased
person's property (collectively known as his estate).

| If the deceased person **made a Will** | If the deceased person died **without making** a Will |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| He would have appointed a person(s) | A person would normally have to be  |
| called an executor(s) to take       | appointed as an administrator(s) to |
| charge of the estate.               | take charge of the estate.          |
| The appointed executor has to    | |
| apply for a **Grant of Probate** | |

In order to be recognised legally as the executor(s) or administrator(s) of the deceased
person's estate, you would have to apply for a Grant of Probate or a Grant of Letters of
Administration respectively.

**What is Probate?**

It is a Court Order authorising the executor(s) appointed by the
deceased person under his Will to administer his estate according to the
directions contained in his Will.

**What are Letters of Administration?**

It is a Court Order authorising the person(s) named in it, to administer
the estate of the deceased person in accordance with the law.

### Who Can Apply For Probate Or Letters Of Administration?

You can apply for probate if you are the executor(s) named in the Will
of the deceased person.

**Letters Of Administration**

In the case of the Letters of Administration, you and any of your family
members are entitled to apply to be appointed administrator(s). However,
the law gives priority to certain members of the family over others,
depending on the marital status of the deceased and his family
composition. For example, if the deceased person was single, his
surviving parents will have priority over his brothers and sisters to be
the administrators; if the deceased person was married with children,
his spouse will have priority over the children to be his administrator.

Please note that the law requires at least 2 administrators to be
appointed where there is/are one or more minor beneficiaries. A minor
beneficiary is any person below 21 years of age who has a share in the
estate. This is to protect the minor beneficiary's interest in the
estate.

**If I have the right to apply for a Grant of Probate or a Grant of
Letters of Administration (as the case may be), can I renounce my right
to apply?**

Yes. If you are the named executor(s) in the Will, or if you are a party
having priority in law to apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration
and you are unwilling or unable to apply for a Grant of Probate or a
Grant of Letters of Administration, you may give up (renounce) your
rights and consent to other persons applying for a Grant of Probate or a
Grant of Letters of Administration by filing a Renunciation and Consent.

In the case of Letters of Administration, you have to file an
Administration Bond to extract the grant. The Administration Bond has to
be signed by you and your sureties, if any.

Where any beneficiary is under 21 years of age, or the value of the
estate exceeds S\$250,000 you are required to furnish 2 sureties to the
Administration Bond. This is to ensure that you administer the estate
properly. The sureties must have assets worth the total value of the
deceased's estate.

After the Registrar approves the particulars of the sureties, they have
to affirm or swear an affidavit certifying their worth. If you cannot
get any person to stand as surety, you may apply to the Court to
dispense with the sureties. You will have to affirm or swear an
affidavit setting out the reasons for your application. You will also
have to obtain the consent of all adult beneficiaries and creditors to
the dispensation of sureties. The Court has the discretion to dispense
with one or both sureties.

**How do I extract the grant?**

After the estate duty matters have been settled, you may apply to
extract the grant. This is done by way of a Request to extract Grant of
Probate or Letters of Administration \[whichever is applicable\] and
filing of the Administration Bond (if it is a case of Letters of
Administration being extracted). before filling the request, you should
conduct a search to ensure that there are no caveats in force against
the estate.

**Must I engage a lawyer?**

### Commonly Asked Questions On Probate / Letter Of Administration

The executor may be required to perform the following, depending on the
contents of the will:

1.  Apply for probate.
2.  Make the arrangements for the funeral of the deceased.
3.  Determine the total assets and liabilities of the deceased.
4.  Resolve the outstanding income tax liability of the deceased,
    according to section 58 of the [Income Tax

5.  Pursue any debts owed to the deceased.
6.  Resolve any debts or liabilities of the deceased. In the case of an
    insolvent estate, the order of priority in the repayment of debts
    can be found in the [Bankruptcy
    Act](http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ac342424a-8867-494a-bbab-91b696d12bdc%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DB%3Btype%3DactsAll;whole=yes),
    after fulfillment of the [First
    Schedule](http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=71399d56-6518-4694-bdd5-87dd81a8d927;page=0;query=DocId%3Af157ad50-12b0-43d2-9734-34a734c957c8%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DP%3BpNum%3D1%3Btype%3DactsAll) of
    the Probate and Administration Act. In the case of a solvent estate,
    the order of repayment can be found in the [Second
    Schedule](http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=cfe43bcd-816c-47fb-8fa7-11dde4d3c225;page=0;query=DocId%3Af157ad50-12b0-43d2-9734-34a734c957c8%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DP%3BpNum%3D1%3Btype%3DactsAll) of
    the Probate and Administration Act.
7.  Distribute the assets to the beneficiaries or their respective
    guardians, in accordance to the will.
8.  Perform your duties in accordance with the Law.

The length of time it would take to carry out the duties of an executor
will depend on various factors. Probate is a complex process, which can
involve many individuals, organizations and government departments.
Insurance companies, banks and Revenue and Customs Authorities are just
some of those that need to be contacted. On average, probate takes
between six to nine months to complete and can take up to eighty working
hours. It is not an unusual occurrence for it to stretch out for as long
as a year, and perhaps even longer if things are not straightforward.

**Contested will:** If the Will is contested, this will certainly
further stretch out the settlement process. Claims regarding the
validity of the will itself can be brought many years after the date of
death. If a claim is made, the estate should not be distributed until
after the claim has been dealt with. The amount of time that Probate
will take will depend on the size and complexity of their estate. A
testator who owned shares, several bank accounts, and more than one
property in different, far off locations would leave a complex
collection of assets for their executor to take stock of. This will be
complicated further if the testator named a number of different
beneficiaries in their Will. If the testator had any creditors, the
executor of the Will needs to settle these, using the assets of the
deceased. This must be done before any money or assets have are to any
beneficiaries, and thus the duties of the executor will not end until
such is achieved.

**How do I compile a list of all the deceased’s assets?**

It is important to identify the assets of the deceased. When doing this,
you should be aware that assets can contain not only real estate and
stock investments, but also any property of value. If there is a Will of
the deceased, you can refer to the assets listed up in the Will. However
you should be careful that the deceased may own more assets than what is
stated in the Will. It may be also give a clue by looking for any unpaid
amounts due the deceased including interest, dividends, and other income
(e.g., in bank statements).

**How do I get a certified true copy of someone’s death certificates?**

Death certificates are issued by the ICA office. Application for
issuance of the certificates can be made online or in person. Applicants
are required to show his/her identity.

For details of the application, please refer to the explanation of
“Apply for Death Extracts” at the website of ICA [^9].

**What if the executor can’t be found?**

If the Executor cannot be found the Court will appoint the fittest
person to administer the deceased's estate according to the Will. The
Court could decide to appoint one or more persons, depending on how the
relevant orders pursuant to the Will and the Letters of Administration
require to do so. The order in considering the persons to be appointed
by Court is as follows:

1. A universal or residuary legatee.
2. A legal personal representative of a deceased universal or residuary legatee.
3. Such person or persons, being beneficiaries under the will, as would have
been entitled to a grant of letters of administration if the deceased had died intestate.
4. A legatee having a beneficial interest.
5. A creditor of the deceased.

**Can an administrator/executor distribute assets to themselves?**

The executor/administrator can distribute the assets to himself if he is
a beneficiary of the deceased's estate. Otherwise it would be a breach
of his duties to do so and the beneficiaries can take action against the
executor/administrator.

It is important to note that Executors have a lot of work. There are
professional executors that charge for their services and there are
non-professional Executors who will only claim reimbursement of their
expenses. Thus part of the assets will be used to pay for the fees
charged by the professional executor, or the reimbursement of the costs
of the non-professional executor.

**Can anyone apply to be an executor/administrator of an estate? Can I
be the executor/administrator of my friend’s estate?**

To become an executor/administrator of someone´s estate, you either have
to be appointed by the Will or by the Court following the rules of
priority to grant such status, as per Section13 of the Probate and
Administration Act. Thus only those persons appointed in the Will or
those who pursuant to Section13 of the Probate and Administration Act
have a right to make such an application to Court.

**In relation to Letters of Administration, what is meant by
administering someone’s estate “in accordance with the law”? What kind
of process/procedure do I have to follow?**

The administration of someone´s estate “in accordance with the law”
refers both to the way the estate should be administered pursuant to the
directions and orders of the person in the will or the rule of
intestacy, as regulated in Intestate Succession Act.

It also refers to the way the Executor has to perform his role (whether
testate or intestate succession), pursuant to the regulations contained
in the Probate and Administration Act.

Accordingly the Executor shall abide to all the applicable and relevant
regulations to his role depending on the circumstances and should also
fully comply with all enforceable regulations contained in the Letters
of Administration.

**Will a Grant of Letters of Administration or a Grant of Probate allow
me to distribute property located overseas?**

No. You will either have to apply for a fresh Grant of Letters of
Administration or a fresh Grant of Probate in that foreign country or
apply for a resealing of the Grant of Letters of Administration or a
resealing of a Grant of Probate which you had already obtained from the
Singapore Courts.

**Can I become the administrator of a non-Singaporean’s Will in another
jurisdiction?**

This would depend on the rules of Probates and Administrator of the
other jurisdiction. For these purposes, the administrator would have to
provide that the power granted to him is enough to manage the estate of
the deceased. Thus it would depend on the jurisdiction and the relevant
laws applicable thereof.

**As a minor, can I change the executor of my will/administrator of my
estate?**

Yes. Executors of Wills that involve minors can be removed because of
the same reasons and other executors (please refer to the section
“removing/replacing administrators/executors”). The minor acts through
his guardian and thus it is the guardian that has file the request
before the Court. The duty to act in the beneficiaries’ best interests
will be more rigorously assessed by the Court when it comes to minors
who have a right to special protection.

**Can an executor of a will be under 21 years old at the time the will
is made?**

Yes, as long as the executor is above the age of 21 at the time of death
of the testator.

**Do multiple executors have to execute the will together? Or do other
beneficiaries have to submit a letter of renunciation first?**

When multiple executors are appointed, they have to act in unison.
Accordingly, they must take all decisions unanimously and all of them
must execute all the documents required to be signed during the
administration of the estate of the deceased and the allocation of the
assets pursuant to the will or the rules of intestacy. Thus, engaging
multiple executors is likely to delay rather than facilitate the
execution process.

## Beneficiaries

**How will I know if I am a beneficiary of a will?**

The executor has the duty to notify all the beneficiaries that they hold
such rights under the will or pursuant to the rules of intestacy. It is
important to note that Singapore has a Wills Registry. The Wills
Registry keeps the following information:

-   Details of the person making the will i.e. testator.
-   Date of the will.
-   Details of the person who drew up the will.
-   Details of where the will is held.

The Wills Registry will not keep a copy nor original version of the
Will.

**Does a beneficiary have to be Singaporean?**

A beneficiary does not have to be Singaporean. However, it is advisable
to duly identify the non-Singaporean either with their passport or local
ID number. The non-Singaporean may be an international charity or a
Permanent Resident in Singapore. It is also important to analyse whether
there will be any restrictions and regulations that will affect the
transfer of certain types of properties such as HDBs in Singapore to
such beneficiaries.

**What are my rights as a beneficiary of a will?**

These rights are:

-   To know if a Will exists.
-   To know the contents of the Will and request a copy of such text.
-   

    To be informed by the executor/administrator of the current status of

    :   his task, and to be informed on how the estate is being managed
        towards distribution of the assets.

-   

    To receive the assets as per stated in the Will or according to the

    :   intestacy rules contained in the Intestate Succession Act.

-   To request the removal of the Administrator/Executor.
-   

    To make an application for a Grant of Probate or a Grant of Letters

    :   of Administration from a Court subject to the provisions of
        Section 13 of the Probate and Administration Act.

**What are my rights as a spouse/child of the deceased? What if we were
not on good terms?**

The starting question is whether there was a will or not. If there was a
Will, the provisions therein will be respected. Nevertheless it is
important to note that there are exceptions as provided in the Wills Act
regarding a minimum welfare that is guaranteed for spouses and children.

As for intestate succession, Section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act
provides that the child and the spouse will be entitled to the
deceased's estate regardless of the quality of their relationship with
the deceased.

**Do ex-spouses have any claim to a deceased’s estate? What about if
there are ongoing divorce proceedings?**

Only surviving current Spouses have a right to claim part of the
Deceased´s estate. However, it is important to note that the ex-Spouse
could be appointed as a Guardian of the surviving children of the
deceased, and in such cases the ex-Spouse can claim part of the estate
for the welfare and upbringing of the children.

Where there is an ongoing divorce, if the proceedings have not been
finalized he/she would still be, before the authorities and the law,
your spouse and thus have all the rights under intestacy law.

**Do children born out of wedlock or as a result of an affair have a
legitimate claim to the deceased’s estate?**

Both illegitimate and adopted children are not included in the intestacy
law rules. Thus under the current statutes they would not have a right
to inherit. In AGG v. Estate of AAH deceased \[2009\] SGCA 56, an
appellant seeking maintenance for her two daughters which where
illegitimate filed a claim for maintenances benefits. The Court
dismissed the appeal based on the fact neither the law nor English
precedents included them. Nevertheless the court did call for a change
in the law to include illegitimate children of a deceased person.

**Can physical abuse and/or harassment between beneficiaries affect
their entitlement to a proportion of an estate/assets?**

Wills can contain certain conditions in order to have the right to
receive the section of the estate allocated. Thus, if the testator
included clauses regarding good relations among the beneficiaries, their
share in the deceased estate could be compromised and reduced
accordingly in situations of abuse and/or harassment.

**Can I contest a Will?**

Yes. If there are any bases upon which the Validity of the Will can be
challenged, the beneficiaries may bring an action for total or partial
invalidation. Examples of the bases upon which the validity of the Will
can be challenged include the lack of fulfilment of formalities required
by the law, or that the deceased lacked mental capacity when the Will
was drafted.

However, it is important to remember there are certain protections that
the law grants to spouses and children in case the portion of the estate
allocated to them in the Will is not sufficient to provide for their
livelihood until they can fend for themselves.

**Can I contest the decision of an executor/administrator?**

Yes. The executor or administrator must perform his duties pursuant to
the instructions of the will and the rules of Administrators and Probate
act. Consequently, when the executor is overreaching its powers by
acting outside of the Will instructions or contrary to the rules of
intestacy, his decision can be contested in Court. Depending on the
effects of the challenged decision on the administration of the estate,
the Court would also consider the removal of the executor.

**Can a beneficiary argue for a greater share of the deceased’s estate,
other than what is specified to them in the will?**

The spouse and children of the deceased have a right pursuant to the
Inheritance (Family Provision) Act to be allocated a portion of the
estate of the deceased for them to secure a minimum welfare standard of
life. Thus if pursuant to the initial allocation of assets in the Will,
the Spouse and the Children are not allocated enough assets for them to
secure a minimum standard of living the spouse and children may apply to
the Court for a further share of the deceased's estate.

Apart from the above, the beneficiaries cannot argue for a bigger share
than what is contained in the Will unless he proves that the Will is
invalid.

**Can I take legal action against an executor or administrator refusing
to carry out their obligations?**

Yes. Any person who believes and has reasonable evidence that the
administrator or executor is not performing his duties pursuant to the
law or the instructions set out in the will can file a claim before the
Probate Court. For example, the executor could have acted without the
required care, or clearly against the law and orders of the Will. It is
important to provide evidentiary support for the allegations contained
in the claim, as otherwise it would be very hard to reverse an
appointment made in the Will or the Court.

**Can I be “trumped” by another beneficiary listed in the will – i.e.
can they take away my entitlement to the estate?**

If the deceased had nominated you under the **CPF Act**, you shall be
entitled to the funds in the deceased’s CPF account regardless of what
is stated in the latter’s Will.

Similarly, if you are **the spouse or child** of the deceased and a
nominated beneficiary under a **life insurance policy or NTUC Income
policy** taken out by the deceased, an implied “irrevocable” trust is
created and cannot be voided by a will. In other words, the policy is a
separate document and does not become part of the estate disposed of by
will regardless of what the Will states.

In the absence of nominations outside of the Will, the provisions of the
Will will be carried out according to the testator’s wishes, so it would
not be a matter of another beneficiary “trumping” your entitlement.

Under certain circumstances, a Will may be treated as invalid by a
court. In such cases, the deceased’s assets will not be distributed
according to the Will, and such assets may instead distributed according
to the Intestate Succession Act.

**Can someone “purchase” my entitlement to a deceased’s estate from
me?**

Distribution of the assets to the estate beneficiaries is the very last
step in the estate settlement process. Consequently, it is only after
settlement of the debts and other liabilities of the estate that
beneficiaries can receive their share of what remains, if any, of the
estate. At this point, and not before, the inheritance becomes your
personal asset, thus allowing you to enjoy the financial benefits, and
giving you the liberty to decide how to dispose of it, including selling
it to another person.

However, depending on the nature of the inherited property, there may
exist some restrictions on transfer, such as when a holding company had
been set up specifically to ensure that the shareholding is fairly
divided amongst your family members, and the shareholder’s agreement
provides that all shareholders are given the first right if any other
shareholder wants to sell their shares. This means that as a
shareholder, you may not be able to simply sell your inherited share
without first offering the same to the other shareholders.

**Can I recover money from a person who is now deceased?**

Even death does not wipe out debts. Settlement of debts has first
priority over estate distribution. It is only when all estate debts have
been settled, or in rare occasions forgiven, that the residual estate
can be distributed amongst beneficiaries.

As a creditor, you may lodge a caveat on the estate. Until all creditors
are satisfied that there are sufficient funds in the estate and there is
an undertaking from the estate’s legal representative to settle the debt
before distribution is present, the caveat will not be removed, and the
letter of administration or grant of probate will not be issued.

Be advised though, that if there is no formal IOU, it would be very
difficult for you to recover from the estate. The estate legal
representative is under no legal obligation to recognise such loans, let
alone settle it. However, if there is admissible evidence, like a
bounced cheque issued by the debtor shortly before he dies, you can file
a caveat on the estate.

1. Inconsequence of the discovery of a will/codicil involving a
   substantial change in the disposition of the deceased’s estate
2. In consequence of a question whether a person had an interest in the
   estate; or as to the nature of an interest in the estate, not having
   been determined at the time when representation was first taken out, or;
3. In consequence of some other circumstances affecting the
   administration or distribution of the estate.
